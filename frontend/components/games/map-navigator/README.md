# Map Navigator

**Level:** 3 (hard), the only level for this game
**Skill:** spatial (spatial orientation)
**Files:** `index.tsx` (UI & game loop), `data.ts` (grid graph, BFS shortest path, landmarks)

## How to Play

- **Map:** An SVG top-down town map built on a 4x4 grid of 16 junctions connected by roads. In each round, 3–5 random road segments are removed while maintaining a connected town graph.
- **Landmarks:** 6 to 8 familiar landmarks are placed on junctions (Home 🏠, Temple 🛕, Market 🛒, Pharmacy 💊, Bus stop 🚌, Tea shop 🍵, Pond 🌊, School 🏫).
- **Session Structure (4 Rounds):**
  - **Round 1:** 2 target goals
  - **Round 2:** 2 target goals
  - **Round 3:** 3 target goals
  - **Round 4:** 3 target goals + Go Home
- **Phases:**
  1. **MEMORISE (15s):** The map displays Home and numbered SVG circle goal badges (1, 2, 3) on the target landmarks. A 15-second countdown timer runs with the text "Remember where to go".
  2. **NAVIGATE:** Goal badges are hidden. An instruction banner displays the target goals in order (e.g. "Go to: 🛕 Temple, then 🛒 Market"). The player starts at Home and navigates step-by-step by tapping adjacent junctions (highlighted as large >=56px circles). The path walked is drawn on the map.
  3. **GO HOME (Round 4):** After reaching the 3rd goal in Round 4, the Home marker is hidden from the map and the player is asked "Now find your way back home".
  4. **HINT SYSTEM:** If the player makes 3 moves in a row that do not decrease the BFS shortest-path distance to the current active goal, that goal landmark flashes gold for 2 seconds and a hint is recorded.

## Scoring

- **Round Efficiency:**
  $$\text{Efficiency} = \min\left(100, \left\lfloor \frac{\text{Shortest Path Length (BFS)}}{\text{Player Path Length}} \times 100 \right\rfloor\right)$$
- **Session Score (0–100):**
  $$\text{Session Score} = \max\left(0, \min\left(100, \text{Average Efficiency} - 10 \times \text{Total Hints}\right)\right)$$
- `roundEfficiency` and `totalHints` are logged to the browser console via `console.log`.
