# Plan the Day

**Level 1 (easy) · Skill: sequencing and planning · No timer**

One session has 5 rounds. Every round asks the same thing: put everyday things in the order they happen.

## Rules

### Rounds 1–2: Steps of a task

- Shows 3 or 4 picture cards from a familiar Indian everyday task, such as making tea, a temple visit or cooking rice.
- Tap the cards in order. Each tap fills the next numbered slot. Tap a placed card to send it back.
- Press **Check** when all slots are full. Cards in the right place turn green. Any other card stays neutral and shows a hint, such as "Goes in step 3".

### Rounds 3–4: Errand planner

- Shows a map with Home, Market, Pharmacy, Temple and Bank, three errands, and one rule (for example "🏦 Bank opens 10 AM").
- The day starts at 9 AM and each errand takes 1 hour, so the three slots are 9, 10 and 11 AM.
- Tap the errands into order and press **Go**. A figure walks the route on the map.
- If the order breaks the rule, the errand that breaks it is outlined in amber and a one-line hint appears, such as "The bank opens at 10 AM. Go there later." The user can change the order and press Go once more.
- If the second try also breaks the rule, a valid order is shown in green and the game moves on.
- Any order that keeps the rule is correct. There isn't one fixed answer.

### Round 5: Personal

The first option that's available is used:

1. **Photos of the user's day.** `GET /day-frames?date=YYYY-MM-DD` uses the date chosen on `/games`. If it returns 3 or more frames, the user puts them in order ("Put your day back in order"). Each photo's time appears after Check.
2. **Caregiver routine.** If `GET /routine` returns 3 or more steps, the user orders those steps.
3. **Another errand round.**

To set the routine (3–5 steps in order, each 1–40 characters; it is stored in `backend/routines.json`):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/routine -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"steps": ["Wake up", "Drink coffee", "Walk in the park", "Read the paper"]}'
```

## Scoring

Each round is worth 20 points, for a total of 0–100.

| Round type | Points |
|---|---|
| Steps (task, photos or routine) | correct positions / number of cards × 20 |
| Errand planner | 20 if correct on the first try, 10 if correct after the fix, otherwise 0 |

The total goes to `onFinish`. `GameShell` rounds it and saves it to `POST /performance` with `game_id: "plan-the-day"`.

## Content

`data.ts` has 12 step tasks and 10 errand sets. Each session picks 2 tasks and 2–3 errand sets at random, so rounds rarely repeat. Rules are one of three kinds:

| Kind | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `closes` | the errand must be finished by that hour | "Pharmacy closes 11 AM" |
| `opens` | the errand can't start before that hour | "Bank opens 10 AM" |
| `before` | errand A must come before errand B | "Buy milk before making tea" |

With three 1-hour errands from 9 AM, the day ends at 12 PM, so a "closes" rule at 12 or later can never be broken. Use 10 or 11 AM.

`rules.check.mjs` tests the rule logic and checks that every task has 3–4 distinct steps, and that every errand set has 3 errands at known places and a rule that some orders keep and others break. Run it after changing the content:

```bash
cd frontend
node components/games/plan-the-day/rules.check.mjs
```
